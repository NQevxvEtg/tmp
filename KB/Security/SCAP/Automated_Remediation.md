### 1. **OpenSCAP Automated Remediation**

OpenSCAP provides the ability to generate remediation scripts based on the compliance scans, which can be run to enforce STIG compliance automatically.

#### Steps

1. **Install OpenSCAP** and **SCAP Security Guide** on your system:
   
   ```bash
   yum install openscap-scanner scap-security-guide -y
   ```

2. **Run the OpenSCAP Scan** with the DISA STIG profile to identify non-compliant configurations:

   ```bash
   oscap xccdf eval --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_stig \
   --results /tmp/scan-results.xml --report /tmp/scan-report.html \
   /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel8-ds.xml
   ```

3. **Generate a Remediation Script**:
   Based on the scan results, OpenSCAP can generate a Bash remediation script that automatically applies changes to meet STIG requirements.

   ```bash
   oscap xccdf generate fix --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_stig \
   --results /tmp/scan-results.xml --output /tmp/remediation-script.sh \
   /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel8-ds.xml
   ```

4. **Apply the Remediation Script**:
   Run the generated script to apply the remediations:

   ```bash
   bash /tmp/remediation-script.sh
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - The **`oscap xccdf eval`** command scans the system against the STIG profile.
   - **`generate fix`** creates a script based on the scan results that, when executed, enforces configurations to meet compliance.
   - Running the script ensures the system is remediated per STIG standards.

### 2. **Ansible STIG Role for RHEL**

Ansible, combined with a STIG role, enables you to configure and enforce STIG compliance across multiple systems efficiently.

#### Steps

1. **Install Ansible** and the RHEL STIG role from **Ansible Galaxy**:

   ```bash
   yum install ansible -y
   ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
   ```

   `requirements.yml`:
   ```yaml
   - src: RedHatOfficial.rhel8_stig
   ```

2. **Create an Ansible Playbook** to apply the STIG role:

   ```yaml
   # hardening_playbook.yml
   - hosts: all
     roles:
       - role: RedHatOfficial.rhel8_stig
         vars:
           rhel8stig_disa_stig: true
   ```

3. **Run the Playbook** on the target system(s):

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory hardening_playbook.yml
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - The **Ansible Galaxy role** `RedHatOfficial.rhel8_stig` contains tasks specifically designed to enforce RHEL STIG configurations.
   - The playbook specifies the role and activates the `disa_stig` profile, applying all related hardening settings.
   - **Running the playbook** executes all tasks from the role, bringing the system into compliance with DISA STIG.

### 3. **SCAP Compliance Checker (SCC)**

DISA’s SCAP Compliance Checker (SCC) can scan and remediate compliance issues with pre-configured STIG profiles, creating a report and automatically generating remediation actions.

#### Steps

1. **Download and Install SCC** (from DISA’s official site).

2. **Run an SCC Scan** with the STIG profile:

   ```bash
   scc --benchmark stig --report /tmp/scc-report.html
   ```

3. **Generate and Apply a Remediation Script**:
   SCC typically generates recommendations or scripts for remediation, which you can run as follows:

   ```bash
   bash /tmp/scc-remediation.sh
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - The **SCC tool** is designed to assess compliance directly against DISA STIG benchmarks.
   - Running the **report** will scan the system, and SCC may offer the option to output a remediation script.
   - **Applying the remediation script** (if available) will enforce compliance based on the SCC’s analysis.

### 4. **Chef InSpec for Automated Remediation**

Chef InSpec is a compliance tool that codifies compliance requirements, applying them as tests or remediation code that can be run across multiple servers.

#### Steps

1. **Install Chef InSpec** on your control system.

   ```bash
   curl https://omnitruck.chef.io/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -P inspec
   ```

2. **Create a STIG Compliance Profile** using InSpec:

   ```bash
   inspec init profile rhel8-stig
   ```

3. **Write Controls** in the `controls` folder of the profile (for example, a password complexity rule):

   ```ruby
   control 'xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_accounts_password_pam_minlen' do
     impact 1.0
     title 'Ensure password minimum length is 14 or more'
     describe file('/etc/security/pwquality.conf') do
       its('content') { should match /^minlen\s*=\s*14/ }
     end
   end
   ```

4. **Run InSpec Scan and Remediation**:

   ```bash
   inspec exec rhel8-stig --reporter cli
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - **Chef InSpec profiles** contain compliance rules written as code. You can write your own profiles for specific STIG controls.
   - **InSpec exec** runs the profile, checking compliance against defined controls.
   - Chef InSpec itself does not directly remediate but integrates well with Chef Infra to enforce these controls automatically in managed environments.
